<h1>MBNPy</h1>

<h3>A Python toolkit for risk-informed, white-box decision-making on complex systems</h3>
<p class="message"> Are you looking for <b>a risk assessment tool that handles simultaneously multiple types of variables AND complex systems?</b> Then MBNPy is the right tool for you! </p>
  
<p>As <b>a companion toolkit of <em>matrix-based Bayesian network</em> (MBN)</b>, MBNPy is a probabilistic analysis tool specialised for <b>large-scale, discrete-state system events. </b> <b>MBNPy integrates Bayesian network (BN) and System Reliability methods (SRMs)</b> to address multiple types of variables and complex systems together.</b></p>

<h3>Bayesian network</h3>
Bayesian network (BN) is a probabilistic graphical model that visualises statistical dependencies between variables. A typical BN graph for a system event is as follows:

BN is a very useful tool for probabilistic analysis of engineering systems:
<ol>
  <li><b>a complex joint probability distribution can be readily quantified</b> by being broken down to local distributions between directly connected components; and</li>
  <li><b>new information can be systematically incorporated to update an entire model</b> through observation nodes.</li>
</ol>

However, <b>the problem arises from the converging structure between components $X_1, \cdots, X_N$ and system $S$.</b> The relationship is defined by the $(N+1)$-dimensional distribution $P(S | X_1, \cdots, X_N)$. <br>
When a system has 50 binary-state components, there are more than $10^{15}$ possible state combinations; if a combination can be analysed for 0.001 seconds, it takes 35,702 years to complete computation. 

<h3>Matrix-based BN</h3>

MBN and its companion toolkit MBNpy solve this challenge by two approahces:
